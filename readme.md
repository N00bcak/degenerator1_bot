# Degenerator_bot

tl;dr I got bored and decided to make a bot which let you play a variant of Wordle on it. 

This was a one-off project created some time around the end of 2021. 

It showcases some basic functions of the telegram bot API, like commands and sending messages.

It's pretty hard but you'll never lose so I guess it builds character when you try and (eventually) succeed (or give up, I guess).

This project was cobbled together pretty hastily, but I don't really have much else to add to this bot since my friends and I don't use Telegram anymore.
